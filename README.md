# Blend API Specifications

## Introduction
Since version 3.0.0 of our API, Blend provides OpenAPI-compliant YAML files that describe the API's available to Blend's partners and customers.

# Release Notes
Blend releases major versions of our API once a year and minor versions once a quarter. Patch versions are released on an as-needed basis against the existing stable minor version. The latest stable version will be marked _stable. The newest possible version's yaml will be marked _experimental, denoting that the API is not stable and should only be used for development purposes.

## Resources
See the [Blend Developer Portal](https://developers.blend.com/blend) for more information and detailed documentation, including quick start guides and example implementations.

## Getting Started
Simply import the OpenAPI spec of your version of choice to your editor to get to work. We also provide importable Postman collections to allow you to quickly and easily interact with the API via the free third-party API exporer [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). To learn how to import our collection JSON files, see the [Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/data-formats/#importing-postman-data).
