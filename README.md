# Blend API Specifications

## DEPRECATED
As of 3/1/2024, this repository has been deprecated. To access our OpenAPI docs, please visit https://developers.blend.com/blend/openapi.

## Introduction
Since version 3.0.0 of our API, Blend provides OpenAPI-compliant YAML files that describe the API's available to Blend's partners and customers.

## Release Notes
Blend releases major versions of our API once a year and minor versions once a quarter. Patch versions are released on an as-needed basis against the existing stable minor version. The latest stable version will be marked _stable. The newest possible version's yaml will be marked _experimental, denoting that the API is not stable and should only be used for development purposes.

## Resources
See the [Blend Developer Portal](https://developers.blend.com/blend) for more information and detailed documentation, including quick start guides and example implementations.

## Getting Started
You may leverage the OpenAPI spec along with a host of open source tools to automatically generate code stubs, tests, and more in a number of popular coding languages. We also provide importable Postman collections to allow you to quickly and easily interact with the API via the free third-party API explorer [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). To learn how to import our collection JSON files, see the [Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/data-formats/#importing-postman-data).
